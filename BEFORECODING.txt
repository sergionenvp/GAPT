We are going to merge our features in the release branch once we alredy TESTED the code in the branch we are working on.

MAIN BRANCH --> FINAL VERSION OF THE PROJECT
RELEASE BRANCH --> MERGE OUR WORK ONCE IS TESTED 
WORKSHOP BRANCHES --> TO CODE AND TEST. NAME THE BRANCH WITH A SPECIFIC NAME TO KNOW WHO IS WORKING AND WHAT IS DOING.

NEVER TEST ON THE RELEASE BRANCH OUR CODE, TEST ON THE BRANCH WE ARE WORKING.
